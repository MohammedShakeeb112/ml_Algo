# STEPS
# 1. Import the data (.csv files)
# 2. Clean the data (remove unwanted data)
# 3. Split the data into Training/Test sets (Data is divided in 80% for Training and 20% for Test purpose)
# 4. Create a Model (Selecting algorithm to analyze the data such as - DECISION TRACE,NEURAL NETWORK)
# 5. Train the Model - feeding the data for look into pattern
# 6. Make the Predictions - MOdel will make predictions on the basis of data provided which results to give o/p in not upto the accurate
# 7. Evaluate and Improve (Optimizing the accuracy)


# LIBRARIES
1. Numpy - Provide MultiDimensional Array
2. Pandas - Data Analysis library provide concept of Data Frame which is 2 Dimensional Array (Rows&Columns) - such as ms excel sheet
3. MatPlotlib - Creating graph & plot feature which is 2 Dimensional plotting library 
4. Scikit-Learn   - ML library provide DECISION TRACE,NEURAL NETWORK
